Parser
======

RPN BASIC Parser, written in C++.

Next steps:
 - Add customizable commands, so this package can be extended
 - Add this package to CodeMonkey
 - Extend the rest of CodeMonkey in this parser, so that it can be my own little library language

Resource files:
 - Language.txt: The language definition
 - simpleAdd.txt: A basic program to demonstrate features
